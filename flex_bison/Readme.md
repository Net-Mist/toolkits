parsing of cooklang
https://lafibre.info/images/doc/201705_lex_yacc_tutorial.pdf


strictly better version of cooklang:
* support block comment
* support "-" symbole in words (needed for "croque-monsieur")
* compile quickly
* full support of UTF-8 without listing all the symbols
* better separation between lexer and grammar
* solve the space issue
